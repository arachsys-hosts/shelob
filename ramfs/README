This is a build script for the initramfs used for booting and emergency
maintenance on Arachsys machines. Build with 'build' and verify with
'test' if hyper and guest/boot/linux are available.

If boot is interrupted by pressing Enter at the maintenance prompt on
any of the machine consoles, the system can be restarted using the normal
reboot command when ready. Exiting from the shell will not cause a reboot.
